## How to be featured here

Is your organisation using Fastify? That's great!

If you would like your organisation to have its logo featured in this list, here's how you do it!

You can submit your organisation, your logo and other few relevant details by following these steps:

1. Fork the [Fastify website repository](https://github.com/fastify/website-next) on GitHub.
2. Add the logo in the folder `src/website/content/images/organisations`.<br/>Please make sure that your logo complies to the following specs:

- Encoded in SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) format.
- Be reasonably optimized/minified (you can use [imageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/)).
- Make sure image "width" or "height" are explicitely specified in the "svg" tag.

3. Update the file `src/website/data/organisations.yml` with a new entry (in alphabetical order by organization name).<br/>Your entry must provide:

- `name`: the name of your organisation
- `image`: the filename of the logo you added in the previous step
- `link`: a link to a website that represents your organisation (please include `http(s)://`)
  <br />
  Please, make sure not to break the YAML syntax of the file.

4. Submit a PR!<br/>As soon as your PR is reviewed and merged, your awesome logo will appear in this page.
